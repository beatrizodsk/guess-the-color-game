## How To Play

The game kicks off only when you say so - just hit that "START" button!

You'll have a speedy 30 seconds to guess as many colors as you can. Each round starts with a random color displayed on the screen, along with three color options in hexadecimal format. Your job? Pick the right one!

## Scoring

If you're lightning-fast and guess correctly, you'll score a cool 5 points!
Don't worry if you're a bit slow - you'll still nab 3 points.
But beware, if you run out of time or choose wrong, you'll lose 2 points. Oops!
Keep an Eye On:
Your "HIGH SCORE" will always remember your best performance - it's your personal best! üèÜ

On the left, you'll see the "CURRENT/LATEST GAME" history. It's like your colorful journey journal, showing which colors you nailed, which ones slipped away, and how fast you answered. But remember, it resets every time you start a new game.

And here are the game's magic buttons:

"START" begins your color adventure.
"RESTART" lets you reset the current game if you're not feeling it.
"RESET ALL DATA" wipes the slate clean - say goodbye to all saved game data.
So, are you ready to dive into the world of colors and chase that high score? Let's get guessing! üé®üöÄ
